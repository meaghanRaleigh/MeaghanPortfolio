								<p>I live in Minneapolis with my husband, daughters: six and two, two dogs, and three cats. It's a small zoo here. I love to read, crochet, knit, and sometimes sew in my spare time. You will often find me listening to Icelandic folk metal. I enjoy going up to the North Shore area to see Lake Superior, and to collect rocks. I drink more coffee than is probably normal for a human. If you like what you see lets connect!
